# Project Architecture

## Overview
The architecture of the project is designed to be modular and scalable. It consists of several key components that work together to provide the desired functionality.

## Components
1. **Frontend**: The user interface that interacts with users and displays data.
2. **Backend**: The server-side logic that processes requests and manages data.
3. **Database**: The storage layer that holds the application's data.

## Interaction
- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- The backend interacts with the database to retrieve and store data.

## Conclusion
This architecture allows for easy maintenance and scalability as the project grows. Each component can be developed and deployed independently, facilitating a more agile development process.
